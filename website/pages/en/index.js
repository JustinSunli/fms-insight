    <h2>Automation Management And Performance Improvement</h2>
    <MarkdownBlock>
      FMS Insight is used by industrial engineers, floor managers, and operators
      to enhance an automated handling system in a flexible machining cell. We
      have observed that an event log allows process actions such as inspections
      which guarantee each path is periodically inspected. Data integration with
      the cell controller simplifies operations and leads to higher efficiency.
